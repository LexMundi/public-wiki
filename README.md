# Prototype of a gated-wiki

## Technical Architecture

1. TiddyWIKI (portable self-cointained notes)
2. ??? assembly doc (markdown -> XML -> ??? PDF)
3. (pro-tem) Lobby + Brave brower
4. ??? something to manage the gated roles + account abstractions

## Use Case

LexDAO public goods for `law-in2-code via gated wiki (lie Lobby) but use XHTML for 2nd stage, ignore 3rd for now.

OpenWiki might have basic definitions (eg Trust) but 2nd gated layer would be a case study of NZ blind trust with C-Corp.
